##Script bases_count.py:   
```    
  Calculates the length of the sequence using a count function and the proportions of different bases    
  Use the following command to run the script    
  > python bases_count.py
```

##Script nucleotide_length.py
```
  Calculates the length of the sequence using the function len and the proportions of different bases     
  Use the following command to run the script    
  > python nucleotide_length.py
```

## Script read_in.py
```
  Calculates the lenght of any fasta sequence using the function len and the proportion of different bases    
  Use the following command to run the script substituting your sequences file for data.txt    
  > python read_in.py data.txt    
```
